# Implementation Plan: Dynamic Landing Page (Auto‑Generated)

**Branch**: `008-dynamic-landing` | **Date**: 2025-11-10 | **Spec**: ./spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-dynamic-landing/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Render a beautiful, responsive landing page directly from structured brochure JSON (Spec 6). Sections (Overview, Amenities, Connectivity, Floor Plans with zoom, FAQs) are dynamically generated with TailwindCSS styling and Framer Motion animations. Hide empty sections gracefully. No hardcoded data.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: React 18 (Vite)  
**Primary Dependencies**: TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, React Image Lightbox (or similar), Axios  
**Storage**: None required (client-side only; JSON provided by Spec 6)  
**Testing**: Manual UI scenarios; viewport responsiveness checks; no API contracts required  
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop/tablet/mobile)  
**Project Type**: Web application frontend  
**Performance Goals**: Interactive readiness ≤ 3s after JSON available; smooth animations  
**Constraints**: No hardcoded data; graceful handling of missing sections; accessible contrast and motion

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Simplicity: One parent component renders modular sections. PASS
- Intelligence: Uses structured outputs from Spec 6. PASS
- Speed: Lightweight components, lazy images, smooth animations. PASS
- Reliability: Hides empty sections; fallback image handling. PASS
- Data Privacy & Security: No sensitive data stored; client‑side only. PASS
- Accessibility & Performance: Responsive layout, contrast, reduced layout shift. PASS
- Observability & Logging: Frontend only; rely on browser devtools for QA. PASS

**Structure Decision**: Implement a `components/dynamic` folder with one React component per section and a parent `DynamicLandingPage.jsx`. Use a placeholder asset for missing images. No new backend contracts required.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
